I’m Meghna.

I work as a software engineer, but I’ve always liked
keeping track of the things I learn and create —
not as achievements, but as memory.

I read across fiction and non-fiction,
paint mostly in acrylics,
enjoy board games for the quiet strategy,
and write code for a living.

This space exists so things don’t get lost.

If you found your way here, welcome.
