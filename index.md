## Meghna

I’m a software engineer who likes collecting things that stay —
lines from books, thoughts from games, colors from paintings,
and ideas that finally made sense.

This is a personal archive.
Slow, honest, and unfinished by design.

### 📚 Reading
Books and articles that changed how I think.

### 🎨 Painting
Studies, color mixes, and notes from the process.

### 🎲 Board Games
Games I enjoyed, questioned, or want to replay.

### 💻 Coding
DSA patterns and mental models that clicked.

### ☁️ AWS
Concepts explained simply, for future me.
